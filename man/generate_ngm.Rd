\title{Calculate next generation contact matrices}
\usage{
generate_ngm(x, age_breaks, R_target, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data input - could be a \code{conmat_population} object or a \code{conmat_setting_preduction_matrix}.}

\item{age_breaks}{vector depicting age values with the highest age depicted
as \code{Inf}. For example, c(seq(0, 85, by = 5), Inf)}

\item{R_target}{target reproduction number}
}
\description{
Once infected, a person can transmit an infectious disease to
another, creating generations of infected individuals. We can define a
matrix describing the number of newly infected individuals in given
categories, such as age, for consecutive generations. This matrix is
called a "next generation matrix" (NGM).
}
\details{
The NGM can be used to calculate the expected number of secondary
infections in a given age group. Given certain age breaks, we compute the
unscaled next generation matrices for that location across different
settings & age groups using the contact rates extrapolated from POLYMOD
survey data on the specified location, adjusted by the per capita
household size and the setting-specific relative per-contact transmission
probability matrices for the same age groups. These NGMs are then scaled
according to a target reproduction number (which is provided as an
argument) using the ratio of the desired R0 and the R0 of the NGM
for the combination of all settings. The R0 of the combination of all
settings is obtained by calculating the unique, positive eigen value of
the combination NGM. This ratio is then used to scale all the setting
specific NGMs.
